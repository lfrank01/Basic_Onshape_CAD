# Sub-Assembly

## Lessons Learned

* The proccess to create a sub-assembly is similar to that of a part studio. Below the part studio option is a button that says assembly. In the assembly, different parts can be added and joined with mates.

* There is a version history and branch tree for OnShape parts. This aspect is very helpful for collaboration. One way to access part versions is to click the insert button located in the top-left corner for assemblies. Here is what it looks like:

* The icon for the "create verison" option is a dotted line with a circle in the middle and plus to the right. 

* Two parts in an OnShape assembly can be joined with one mate! Mate connectors are the features that are used to mate parts. They apear as circles. 

* The keyboard shortcut for a mate is (m). When the mate feature is selected, there are multiple options for mating, such as fastened, parrallel, and revolute.

* Fasten mates do not allow for motion between two parts; revolute mates do. 

* The parallel mate was helpful for aligning the bearing and collar. The purpose of a parallel mate is self-intuitive: it makes two objects parallel. 

* For the revolute mate, there is an option to animate the degrees of freedom which the mate allows. Here is where to find it:
