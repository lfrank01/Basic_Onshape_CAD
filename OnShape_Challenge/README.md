# OnShape Challenge

The parts of the assignment were:
* The Cube
* The Spinner Shaft
* The Bracket
* OnShape Challenge - the final assembly

The goal of the assignment was to practice the use of thin features and different types of mates. The assignment was broad and encouraged students to explore different methods to achieving the final goal, which was a set up that allowed a cube to spin in place.

For the asignment, I assembled two spinner shafts, a bracket, and cube with extruded cylinders. 

Here is my finished product:

## Lessons Learned

* To establish an equal constraint, click on the desired entities and press (e).

* When making the cube Instead of creating four cylinders, I made a circular pattern and the pattern of revolution was a center line that I created in another sketch.
* Make sure that the fillet does not have a flat end. It should be a smooth curve.
* Instead of creating a thin extrude, which OnShape does not seem to have, I created a surface extrusion and then used the thicken feature. The surface extrusion can be found as a tab in the extrusion feature. It exudes a one-dimensional sketch.
* The surface extrude creates a new tab below the different parts called surfaces. The appearance of this is different. 
* Custom color can be selected in aoearances.
* Hide the surface extrusion.
* I used the cylindrical mates on the spinner shafts and revolute mates on the cube and spinner shafts.
* The cylindrical mate found a medium between the two spinner shafts.
