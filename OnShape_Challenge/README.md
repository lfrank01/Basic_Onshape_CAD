The parts of the assignment were:
* The Cube
* The Spinner Shaft
* The Bracket
* OnShape Challenge - the final assembly

The goal of the assignment was to encouraged students to explore different methods of achieving the final goal, which was a set up that allowed a cube to spin in place. The instructions were broad and alowed students to improvise.

For the asignment, I assembled two spinner shafts, a bracket, and cube with extruded cylinders. 

Here is my finished product:

## Lessons Learned

* To establish an equal constraint, click on the desired entities and press (e).

* When making the cube, instead of creating a cylinder on four surfaces seperately, I made only one and used a circular pattern to do all four. The pattern of revolution was a center line that I created in another sketch. Another, and possibly better, pattern of revolution would be a mate connector. A mate connector can be created by control + (m).

* Make sure that the fillet does not have a flat end. It should be a smooth curve. The purpose of a fillet is defeated if it is not a complete curve out of the corner.
* It should look like this:

* Instead of creating a thin extrude, which OnShape does not seem to have, I created a surface extrusion and then used the thicken feature. The surface extrusion can be found as a tab in the extrusion feature. Its purpose is to extrude a one-dimensional sketch. I hid the surface extrusion because it was only neccesary for me to use the thicken feature and having surfaces interferes with the creation of extrusions.

* I used cylindrical mates to connect the spinner shafts with the bracket.
* I used revolute mates to connect the cube and spinner shafts.
* The cylindrical mate was helpful because it esbalished a place in space that allowed for both spinner shafts to function properly without me needing to specify.
* Custom colors can be selected in apearances.
