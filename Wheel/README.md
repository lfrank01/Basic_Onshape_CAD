## Lessons Learned

* There is an undo feature for OnShape, located in the top-left corner. 

* OnShape doesn't require closed sketching, meaning that there are lines intersecting the entite that is selected for an extrude or revolve. If there are lines that are dividing the sketch, the sketch will apear to be in different bodies, which must all be selected when extruding in order to use the entire sketch.

* Some keyboard shortcuts:
  * (w) - zoom in.
  * (f) - fit. 
  
 * The fit feature will size the screen accordingly to show the entire part.
