# Base

## Lessons Learned

The Base assignment was my first OnShape document. Here are my key take aways:

* Keybord shortcuts make OnShape design effieceint. The array of shortcuts can be accessed by clicking the question mark icon in the top-right corner.

* A few keyboard shortcuts are:
  - s = sketch
  - n = normal (to align the view to what is being sketched)
  - d = dimension (smart dimesnion)
  - l = line
  - r = center point rectangle
  - q = corner rectangle 

* Linear patterns save time and energy. A linear pattern takes a sketch or feature and pattern it across an x and y axis.

* To make an extruded cut, click on the extrude feature and change the kind of extrude to remove.
