# Dorothy's Dowel Pins 
## The assignment that introduced me to OnShape configurations.
### The OnShape Document Link: https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/6bb24280c3cd2b6fde31a32d/w/9fd1c031eeefcc2e7e57ac09/e/dd6ec1fd1c10b0866b2490a3
The parts of the assignment were:
* The Dowel Pin
* The Trapezoid 
* Frame - The final assembly

The goal of the assignment was to teach about configurations. I created thirty-two configurations of a dowel pin. A dowel pin is a cylinder-shaped object which is used to increase the structural integrity of a part or assembly. Here is an example of what a steel dowel pin is:

For the asignment, I assembeled a picture frame, using the dowel pins that I created and four trapezoids. The trapezoids had wholes for the dowel pins and two different configurations so that the frame would look like a rectangle. 

OnShape configurations are both efficient and effective. I was able to create thirty-two configurations of one part with minimal difficulty.
