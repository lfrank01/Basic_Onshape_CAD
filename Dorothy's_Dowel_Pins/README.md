# Dorothy's Dowel Pins 
## The assignment that introduced me to OnShape configurations.
### The OnShape Document Link: https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/6bb24280c3cd2b6fde31a32d/w/9fd1c031eeefcc2e7e57ac09/e/dd6ec1fd1c10b0866b2490a3
The parts of the assignment were:
* The Dowel Pin
* The Trapezoid 
* Frame - The final assembly

The goal of the assignment was to teach about configurations. I created thirty-two configurations of a dowel pin. A dowel pin is a cylinder-shaped object which is used to increase the structural integrity of a part or assembly.

For the asignment, I assembeled a picture frame, using the dowel pins that I created and four trapezoids. The trapezoids had wholes for the dowel pins and two different configurations so that the frame would look like a rectangle. 

Here is what my finished product (shaded with hidden edges):

## Lessons Learned:

* Configurations can be found on the far right side of the screen. There are three boxes and the middle was in the middle of the configurations.

* There’s an arrow by the configuration option. I clicked it and chose list configuration, which allows making a list of configurations that have a name and value.

* After creating configurations, the different options can be found in the top-left of the screen.

* To add a second configuration, there is a tool at the bottom of the screen. Different kinds of configuration-styles can be selected. I chose the list option.
* When configuring a measurement, the proper method of writing something such as 1 ½ Inch is (1 in + ½ in). Both parts must have a measurement included. 
* OnShape can also configure features. For configuring a chamfer, I clicked on the suppress option for the chamfer and said yes for one option and no for the other.

* Colors can be configured. Done by double-clicking the appearance for a part or assembly.

* The mate feature, there are options to change rotation and to flip the axis.
* Click on the part that is wanted after generating the configuration to select it.
* Click the solve button when mating to finalize the mate.
* Go slowly with the assembly. I had to redo the mates multiple times.
