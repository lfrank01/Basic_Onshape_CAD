# Caster

## Lessons Learned

* The Caster was created the same way as the sub-assembly; in the part studio tab, there is an option for assembly. 

* The purpose of a bearing is to prevent direct surface-to-surface contact between entities that are in relative motion.

* OnShape makes the use of bolts, screws, and other fasteners super accessible! To access these objects, click on the insert button and then on the "direct contact" tab. Here is what to look for:

* Dr. Shields prefers the ISO standard of measurment. 

* To use a screw, or other fasteners, click on the perimeter of the hole that the screw will insert into, and press the insert button, located at the bottom of the "standard content" option. 

* To select different kinds of fasteners, there is a category option. 

* There is an offset distance feature when mating a connector. What it does is reposition the connector relative to the mate connector. It was helpful when using the locking pins for the Collar and Axle.
